        I thought to myself: If I was going to practice making interactive
        exhibitions for my portfolio, <em>why not make it about a sport that I love?</em>

            This simple digital exhibition was created by Michelle Lee (me!) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It spans the history of pole vault:
            from its origins to modern day, exploring topics such as technique, equipment, and notable athletes. The project
            was inspired by my passion for pole vault, which I practiced at the Division I collegiate level at Columbia University while also 
            obtaining my degree in Computer Science.
            <br><br>
            This work was inspired by digital exhibitions such as The Elders Project by Incite Institute, as well as other websites that I
            have worked with in the past. I hope to continue expanding my creativity and skills in digital storytelling
            in order to make even more immersive and complicated projects in the future.
