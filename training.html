                                olympic lifting, and more. the variety in exercise highlights the focus of not only speed, but also explosiveness,

            <p class="body"><em>running is usually done with poles in hand in order

                                athletes with the feeling of running with a pole. pole vaulters emphasize tall posture,
                                quick foot strikes, and consistent steps in order to maximize speed.

                                like the approach, the takeoff is practiced both on and

                                a good takeoff emphasizes a fully extended body position under the

            <h2>3. the swing</h2>
            <p class="lead">the swing, just as crucial as any other part of the jump, 
                            loads more energy into the pole
                            and sets up the inversion.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="body"><em>the motion of the swing is one that is mimicked off-runway 
                                through various drills such as rope swings, gymnastics, 
                                high bar swings, and other unique devices. unlike gymnastics, pole vaulters are taught
                                to keep their feet flexed instead of pointed. 
            </em></p>
            <p class="body"><em>the swing is taught majorly through a drive knee and a swing leg, 
                                which help create the angular momentum needed for a successful swing. 
                                some coaches, however, may teach the tuck-and-shoot swing instead, which
                                is a bunching of the legs and body together before extending upwards. it is important
                                for the body to be tight and unsegmented during the swing in order to maximize energy transfer.
                                there is also contention between coaches who teach a neutral head position
                                as opposed to a head-back position.

            <p class="lead">the inversion and turn converts horizontal approach and swing energy into vertical lift and successful bar clearance.</p>
            <p class="body"><em>the inversion is practiced through gymnastics-based drills and other calisthenics.
                                athletes practice hanging from high bars, rings, and other apparatuses in order to
                                build the strength and body awareness needed to invert properly. vaulters may also decide to practice from a shorter approach
                                or on a lighter pole in order to work on inversion technique.
                                </em></p>
            </em></p>
            <p class="body"><em>timing and patience are most emphasized here. even with a perfect inversion, without the right timing, it is easy
                                for the vaulter to miss the turn and hit the bar too early or too late. coaches often use video analysis 
                                to break down the timing of the inversion and adjust a vaulter's technique or equipment accordingly. vaulters
                                aim to be as tight and close to the pole during inversion in order to maximize vertical energy upwards.
